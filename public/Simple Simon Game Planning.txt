Simple Simon Game
Premises of the game: Basic Simon Says aspect with buttons.
A player must click the buttons that light up after it finishes its pattern sequence. If player presses the correct buttons, then the next round starts and will add on a new button at the end of its previous pattern sequence. 
Rules: 
	Round 1: 
		Step 1: Press Enter Key to Start 
		Step 2: 1 random button lights up for 1500 milliseconds
		Step 3: Button from Step 2 goes back to normal color
		Step 4: Player presses the button that was lit in Step 2
		Step 5: If player gets it correct, then move on to next round
		Step 5.5: If player doesn’t get it correct, end game.
		Step 5.5a: Return to Press Enter Key to Start Screen

	Round 2: 
		Step 1: Call back previous round’s button
		Step 2: Button from Step 1 goes back to normal color
		Step 3: Add new button following Steps 1 and 2
		Step 4: Player presses the button pattern sequence following Step 3
		Step 5: If player gets it correct, then move on to next round
		Step 5.5: If player doesn’t get it correct, end game.
		Step 5.5a: Return to Press Enter Key to Start Screen

	Round 3 and on: 
		Continue incrementing buttons after each round is over if player presses correct button pattern sequence


What's needed:

Instead of buttons, use div tags that have id's of the color of each box. 
	Use class to shape boxes to be the same 

Like the Konami code, I will need to have a variable that holds an empty array and is called on when I or a player clicks the color box as well as another array that holds each div when clicked on
	If the sequence is correct, move onto the next round.


Global Variables 
// need to figure out correct variable for colors.
// It will be similar to the konami code when performing the function which I'm providing at below 

    	var konami = [38, 38, 40, 40, 37, 39, 37, 39, 66, 65, 13];
    	var keys= [];

        $(document).keyup(function(event){
            console.log(event.keyCode);

        keys.push(event.keyCode);
            if(keys.length > konami.length) {
            	keys.shift();
            }

        if(keys.toString() == konami.toString()) {
            $("body").fadeOut(1000, redirectPage);

        	function redirectPage() {window.open("https://www.youtube.com/v/WxfZkMm3wcg?rel=o&autoplay=1", "_self");
        	}
        }
        });

Functions needed:
Random number generator for each box
Something that calls back previous generated number for each round and adds a new random box at the end of the sequence
